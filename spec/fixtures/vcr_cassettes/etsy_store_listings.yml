        TIERRACAST PEWTER:\r\n\r\nTraditional bench jewelry techniques and state-of-the-art
        technologies are used to carefully create each of their unique designs. They
        draw from decades of jewelry experience, history and ideas from their customers
        to deliver components you can&#39;t find anywhere else.\r\n\r\nTierraCast
        uses a &quot;lead free&quot; tin alloy that exceeds the stringent California
        standards for lead content and complies with the standards for pewter in contact
        with food.\r\n\r\nTierraCast uses &quot;Britannia&quot; casting alloy for
        all cast pewter findings. This alloy containing tin, antimony, and copper,
        is considered &quot;Lead Free&quot; by the metals industry and the jewelry
        trade as it complies with the USDA standard of less than .05% (or 500 parts
        per million) lead content in pewter in contact with food. This alloy also
        complies with California Health & Safety Code section 25214.1 \u2013 25214.3
        that requires lead below 100 ppm and cadmium below 300 ppm.\r\n\r\nTierraCast
        silver and gold plated cast pewter components also meet the eu nickel directive\r\n\r\nSOME
        INTERESTING FACTS FROM THE TIERRACAST WEBSITE:\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many
        jewelry components are made of metal containing substantial and sometimes
        alarming amounts of lead. Tests that we have run on other cast jewelry components
        yield lead contents as noted in the chart below.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBRITANNIA PEWTER:
        \r\nLead content as a % of total .025%\r\nLead content in parts per million:
        40 to 250 PPM\r\nSafety Assessment: \u201clead free\u201d Safe enough for
        eating utensils\r\n\r\nPEWTER: \r\nLead content as a % of total: 8%\r\nLead
        content in parts per million: 80,000 PPM\r\nSafety Assessment: Meets definition
        of pewter\r\n\r\nCAST METAL: \r\nLead content as a % of total: 60% - 94%\r\nLead
        content in parts per million: 600,000 ppm - 940,000 ppm\r\nSafety Assessment:
        Not pewter, most likely a foreign source, be wary\r\n\r\nLead can used in
        pewter alloys because it is easy to cast and less expensive than tin. However,
        lead is a known toxin that accumulates in the body causing numerous physical
        ailments. In recent decades, focus on this problem has resulted in the elimination
        of lead in gasoline and paint. Now there is increasing concern and discussion
        about lead content in metal alloys used in items that come in contact with
        people, particularly children. This has led to the recall of millions of metal
        jewelry items that were manufactured overseas.\r\n\r\nTierraCast takes the
        issues concerning lead very seriously and buys only pewter that is routinely
        tested to comply with stringent FDA limits. This way, we protect our clients,
        ourselves and our environment from exposure to lead. We continue to research
        this issue and will share what we learn as more information becomes available.","policy_payment":"Instant
