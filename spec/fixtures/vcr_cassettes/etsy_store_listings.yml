        I am happy to share my knowledge with anyone who asks. Many of the items in
        this shop have examples shown of design ideas. Feel free to use those designs
        for inspiration.\r\n\r\nABOUT TIERRACAST PEWTER:\r\n\r\nTraditional bench
        jewelry techniques and state-of-the-art technologies are used to carefully
        create each of their unique designs. They draw from decades of jewelry experience,
        history and ideas from their customers to deliver components you can&#39;t
        find anywhere else.\r\n\r\nTierraCast uses a &quot;lead free&quot; tin alloy
        that exceeds the stringent California standards for lead content and complies
        with the standards for pewter in contact with food.\r\n\r\nTierraCast uses
        &quot;Britannia&quot; casting alloy for all cast pewter findings. This alloy
        containing tin, antimony, and copper, is considered &quot;Lead Free&quot;
        by the metals industry and the jewelry trade as it complies with the USDA
        standard of less than .05% (or 500 parts per million) lead content in pewter
        in contact with food. This alloy also complies with California Health & Safety
        Code section 25214.1 \u2013 25214.3 that requires lead below 100 ppm and cadmium
        below 300 ppm.\r\n\r\nTierraCast silver and gold plated cast pewter components
        also meet the eu nickel directive\r\n\r\nSOME INTERESTING FACTS FROM THE TIERRACAST
        WEBSITE:\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many jewelry components are made of metal containing
        substantial and sometimes alarming amounts of lead. Tests that we have run
        on other cast jewelry components yield lead contents as noted in the chart
        below.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBRITANNIA PEWTER: \r\nLead content as a % of total .025%\r\nLead
        content in parts per million: 40 to 250 PPM\r\nSafety Assessment: \u201clead
        free\u201d Safe enough for eating utensils\r\n\r\nPEWTER: \r\nLead content
        as a % of total: 8%\r\nLead content in parts per million: 80,000 PPM\r\nSafety
        Assessment: Meets definition of pewter\r\n\r\nCAST METAL: \r\nLead content
        as a % of total: 60% - 94%\r\nLead content in parts per million: 600,000 ppm
        - 940,000 ppm\r\nSafety Assessment: Not pewter, most likely a foreign source,
        be wary\r\n\r\nLead can used in pewter alloys because it is easy to cast and
        less expensive than tin. However, lead is a known toxin that accumulates in
        the body causing numerous physical ailments. In recent decades, focus on this
        problem has resulted in the elimination of lead in gasoline and paint. Now
        there is increasing concern and discussion about lead content in metal alloys
        used in items that come in contact with people, particularly children. This
        has led to the recall of millions of metal jewelry items that were manufactured
        overseas.\r\n\r\nTierraCast takes the issues concerning lead very seriously
        and buys only pewter that is routinely tested to comply with stringent FDA
        limits. This way, we protect our clients, ourselves and our environment from
        exposure to lead. We continue to research this issue and will share what we
        learn as more information becomes available.","policy_payment":"Instant Transfers,
